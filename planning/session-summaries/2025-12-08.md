# Session Summary - December 8, 2025

## What We Did
- Reviewed current project status and NEXT-STEPS.md
- Confirmed TECH-STACK.md is essentially complete (React Native + Expo, Supabase, Next.js)
- Reviewed MVP-FEATURES.md - draft exists but needs Oliver's input on open questions
- Created email questionnaire for Oliver to finalize MVP feature spec

## Email Sent to Oliver
Questions covering:
- Product: prompt count, max recording length, category requirements
- Business: free vs paid, family plan, trial period, launch date
- Bigger picture: funding, Oliver's capacity, SWITCH resources, early adopters, first 100 users

Removed question about deceased family members (deferred to V2 - content just persists forever for now).

## Waiting On
- Oliver's responses to the questionnaire
- Once received, update MVP-FEATURES.md with his answers

## Current Project State
