            </div>

            <div class="fade-in">
                <p>We live in an age of infinite content, yet so much of what truly matters goes unrecorded. The voice of a grandmother sharing her childhood. The advice a father gives before his daughter's wedding. The laughter that fills a kitchen on Sunday morning.</p>

                <p>These moments are irreplaceable. They carry the weight of love, wisdom, and connection that can't be manufactured or replicated. Yet most of us keep them only in memory — fragile, fleeting, and vulnerable to time.</p>

                <p>Heirloom was born from a simple belief: <strong>your family's stories deserve to last as long as your family does.</strong></p>

                <p>We're building more than an app. We're building a sanctuary for the voices, stories, and memories that define who we are. A place where families can preserve not just what happened, but how it felt. Where children can hear their great-grandparents' voices decades after they're gone. Where love transcends time.</p>

                <p>This isn't about nostalgia. It's about legacy. It's about giving future generations the gift of knowing where they came from — and who walked before them.</p>

                <p>We believe memories should be protected with the same reverence as family heirlooms. Encrypted. Private. Sacred. Built to outlast us all.</p>

                <p>Because the greatest inheritance we can leave isn't money or property. It's the story of who we were, told in our own voices, preserved with intention and passed down with love.</p>
