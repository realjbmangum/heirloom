        Why We Built Heirloom
      </h1>

      <div class="text-charcoal-ink/70 space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Every family has stories worth preserving. The way your grandmother laughed. The advice your father gave on your wedding day. The bedtime stories that shaped your childhood.
        </p>

        <p>
          Too often, these precious moments live only in memory—and when those who lived them are gone, the stories go with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          We built Heirloom because we believe every voice deserves to be heard by future generations. Every story deserves to be preserved. Every family deserves a legacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Heirloom makes it effortless to capture, preserve, and share the stories that make your family unique. With guided prompts, secure storage, and seamless sharing, we're helping families build their legacy—one story at a time.
        </p>
