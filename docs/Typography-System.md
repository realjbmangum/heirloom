✒️ Heirloom Brand Identity — Phase 2: Typography System
Typography Philosophy
Heirloom’s type should feel like a story preserved in time. Every letter carries quiet confidence and grace. Our fonts must evoke trust, beauty, and permanence, yet remain clean and functional in digital experiences.
Think: museum label meets modern journal.

1. Primary Serif (Heritage & Emotion)
Font: Cormorant Garamond
(Free Google Font — designed for elegance and editorial warmth)
Attribute
Description
Use Case
Manifesto text, homepage headers, printed materials, hero quotes
Personality
Classic, emotional, literary
Tone
Feels like a family heirloom — refined but approachable
Styling
Use generous line height and whitespace. Avoid all caps. Keep to sentence or title case.
Example:
“Every family carries a story worth protecting.”  (Cormorant Garamond Regular, 36pt, Letter spacing +2%)

2. Secondary Sans-Serif (Modern & Functional)
Font: Inter
(Open-source, designed for digital legibility and human balance)
Attribute
Description
Use Case
Body text, UI elements, buttons, tooltips, app content
Personality
Clear, confident, unobtrusive
Tone
A quiet guide — helps users focus on their stories, not the software
Styling
Regular for body, Medium for buttons and labels, Bold only for emphasis
Example:
“Record your story in five minutes. Preserve it forever.”  (Inter Regular, 18pt, Line height 1.6)

3. Display Option (Luxury Accents)
Font: Playfair Display
(Optional for titles, decks, and high-end collateral)

Poetic, artistic, timeless

Use sparingly to prevent visual fatigue. Best paired with Inter body text.

5. Logo & Wordmark Direction (Typographic Foundation)
	•	Base logo concept: Heirloom set in Playfair Display with a custom ligature joining the “H” and “l,” representing generational connection. 
	•	Subtext: “Stories that last forever” in Inter Light, letter-spaced for balance. 
	•	Weight preference: keep the logo’s serif elegant and stable, not ornate. 
	•	Use Heritage Green (#0C3B2E) for wordmark on Ivory Linen background. 

6. Typography in Motion
When applied to digital:
	•	Use soft fade-ins or subtle parallax for headers — evoke discovery, not flashiness. 
	•	Apply micro-animations (like a text reveal effect) to highlight quotes or stories. 
	•	Maintain quiet luxury: minimal transitions, no sharp cuts. 

7. Typography Don’ts
	•	No condensed or geometric fonts (they feel techy, not timeless). 
	•	Avoid all-caps paragraphs — reserve for buttons or badges only. 
	•	Never mix more than two type families in one piece of design. 
	•	No overuse of italics — Heirloom should speak calmly, not dramatically.
