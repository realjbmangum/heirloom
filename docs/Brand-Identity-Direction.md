🎨 Heirloom Brand Identity Direction
Phase 1 — The Moodboard

Core Emotion
“Eternal warmth.”  Heirloom is calm, reverent, and deeply human. It carries the stillness of a family chapel, the richness of a leather-bound book, and the trust of fine craftsmanship.  It should feel warm enough for the heart and refined enough for the world of legacy.

Primary Mood Words
Human
Timeless
Sacred
Crafted
Secure
Warm
Nostalgic
Connected
Elegant
Private

Visual Atmosphere
	•	Light: Golden-hour tones, sunlight through leaves, soft glow over forest greens and aged wood. 
	•	Texture: Aged paper, brushed metal, linen, oak grain, glass reflections. 
	•	Composition: Negative space balanced with intimacy. Think of a single candle on a wooden desk or hands holding an old photograph. 
	•	Photography Style: Documentary warmth. Real people, real homes, natural smiles. Avoid stock “posed” family shots. Capture truth and emotion.

Typography

	•	Rounded edges and soft corners, never geometric or sharp. 
	•	Motifs: Hourglass, Key, Tree Ring, Quill, Vault, Lantern. 

Texture & Material References
	•	Digital gold leaf accents (used sparingly, never flashy). 
	•	Faded ink overlays for vintage warmth in print or landing imagery. 
	•	Matte finishes over glossy tones for physical products (cards, packaging, etc.). 
	•	If printed, use soft-touch black paper with embossed gold foil for invitations or investor decks. 

Tone of Voice
Warm, reverent, and honest.  Avoid marketing fluff. Speak like a friend helping preserve something sacred.
Examples:
	•	“Every family carries a story worth protecting.”

	•	“Where memories live forever.”
