🕊️ Heirloom Tone-of-VoiceGuidelines

1. Core Voice Philosophy
Heirloom speaks like a gentle archivist of the soul — calm, steady, and deeply human.  Every word should feel like it was written with care, not haste.  Our language bridges technology and tenderness, blending timelessness with ease.
We don’t sell software. We keep stories safe.  We don’t instruct. We invite.

2. Tone Pillars
Pillar
Description
Do Say
Avoid
Warm
Speak with empathy and calm. Words should comfort.
“Your story matters here.”
“Upload your file.”
Eternal
Use timeless phrasing, not trends. Write as if the message will be read fifty years from now.
“Preserve what endures.”
“Capture your content now!”
Trustworthy
Be clear, honest, and unhurried. No hype.
“Your memories are encrypted and stored safely.”
“Guaranteed forever!”

3. Writing Principles
A. Speak Human.  Use conversational language that respects emotion without oversimplifying it.
“Every family carries a story worth keeping.”
B. Lead with Heart, Support with Clarity.  Emotion opens the door. Logic earns trust.
“Heirloom protects your family’s memories with private, encrypted storage — so you can share what matters with peace of mind.”
C. Use Short Sentences with Space to Breathe.  Heirloom’s voice moves slowly, like a reflection.
“Take a few minutes today. Tell a story that will outlive you.”
D. Choose Words That Feel Lived In.  Prefer family, memory, voice, story, legacy, generations, belonging, time, safe, keep, protect, love, gift, journey, wisdom.  Avoid user, content, upload, platform, data, device, feature.
E. Never Lecture or Sell.  We guide, we never push.
“Start with one story. The rest will follow.”

	•	Pair gentle words with soft light or texture — linen, parchment, wood. 
	•	The tone should feel like handwriting on fine paper, not typed commands.
